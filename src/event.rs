//! The `event` module contains traits and structs to actually run your game mainloop
//! and handle top-level state, as well as handle input events such as keyboard
//! and mouse.
//!
//! If you don't want to use `ggez`'s built in event loop, you can
//! write your own mainloop and check for events on your own.  This is
//! not particularly hard, there's nothing special about the
//! `EventHandler` trait.  It just tries to simplify the process a
//! little.  For examples of how to write your own main loop, see the
//! source code for this module, or the [`eventloop`
//! example](https://github.com/ggez/ggez/blob/master/examples/eventloop.rs).
